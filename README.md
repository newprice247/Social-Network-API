  ## Description

  The goal of this project was to build an API for a social network web application that uses Express.js for routing, and a MongoDB database that stores the data by utilizing the Mongoose ODM library. The app will offer a place where users can share their thoughts, react to freinds' thoughts, and create a friend list.

  ## Installation
* Clone the repository to local storage
* Navigate to the folder inside your terminal and run 'npm install' to install the necessary node modules
* Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine, if you need help [here's a guide to get you started](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide)

* In your MySQL shell or workbench, source the schema.sql file that is located in the 'db' folder to get the e-commerse-back-end database and tables populated. The commands should look something like this: 

        mysql> source ..\E-Commerce-Back-End\db\schema.sql

* Return to your node terminal and run 'npm run seed' to populate the database with the provided table data.

* Now that the database has some data, run 'npm start' in your terminal to start the application! 
 

  

  ## Usage
* Once the prerequisite files are installed, locate the 'E-Commerce-Back-End' folder inside your terminal, and run 'npm start'

* Because the app is entirely back-end, you will need to use an API platform such as [Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/get-started#:~:text=Insomnia%20is%20an%20open%20source,code%20generation%2C%20and%20environment%20variables.) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the functionality of the app.
